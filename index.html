                I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and it was the best decision ever. The
                yacht was spacious, comfortable, and luxurious, and the crew took care of everything.

                The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The cabins were spacious and elegant, and
                the outdoor areas were perfect for relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
